        <h4 class="projectTitle">Make your own Logo</h4>
        <p>In this project, you will create your own personal logo.</p>
        <p>A logo is a a symbol or other design adopted by an organization to identify its products, uniform, vehicles, etc.</p>
        <p>As you can imagine, a logo is crucial to a company, but it is also the first design that a client sees featuring your brand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Melina Sapiano, and this is my personal logo</p>
        <img src="./GraphicDesignV2_files/melinalogo.png" height="200">
        <p>As many GraphicDesigners do, I freelance. I have used this logo for my self-published book of concept and game art. My logo, while not a standard GraphicDesigner's logo is unique to my work and style. Clients are able to see my distinct logo and expect a certain style from me. In turn, you will do this as well.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Criteria</h4>
        <p>The criterion for the logo design project is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You are tasked to create a logo design that represents <strong>you</strong> as a person. Your logo should represent/symbolize your <strong>personal interests and beliefs</strong>. A good way to start is think about what you love, what you like to do, or something you think is really interesting that <strong>resonates</strong> with you.</li>
          <li>Follow the logo design process (provided below).</li>
          <li>Use up to three colors (no more) within the design: keep it simple, not too visually distracting.</li>
          <li>Create an initial sketch of the logo.</li>
          <li>Create a final computer GraphicDesign of your logo.</li>
        </ol>

            <p>Before you start designing, you’ll need to do research</p>
            <p>Research will make you a better designer, saving you a lot of thinking time. This step is crucial. You'll become more engaged with the client's needs, making your design far superior than the rest. Don't skip this step if you're entering a freelance design contest, as some time spent on research (up to 30 mins) will give you an advantage.</p>
              <br>
            <p>Look at:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Understand the business: look at other GraphicDesigner's logos. Go ahead and Google other GraphicDesigners!</li>
              <li>Target demographic (age, gender, location). Think about who would commission you? Who are your clients?</li>
              <li>History & culture of the brand. While you are just starting as a GraphicDesigner, you need to understand the culture you are now a part of.</li>

          <h6>Now is the time to pull all your ideas together.</h6>
          <p>Do this part by hand. <strong> Do not open GIMP yet </strong></p>
          <br>
          <p>Get a piece of paper and pen or pencil. Do a few small, quarter sized examples. These are called <strong>thumbnails</strong>. Thumbnails are used by GraphicDesigners and photographers for a small image representation of a larger images, usually intended to make it easier and faster to look at or manage a group of larger images.</p>
          <p>These do not need to be perfect representations. You should do 3-5 quick thumbnails. They do not need to be ornately details, just clear enough for you to understand the premise.</p>
          <p>Start by creating symbols or motifs. Explore and test typefaces and keep in mind the latest logo and GraphicDesign trends when you're working. Make sure to jot all your ideas down.</p>
          <img src='./GraphicDesignV2_files/step2brainstorm.jpg' height='200'>
          <p> Thumbnails are an irreplaceable part of the design process. It may seem trivial when you have a very vivid idea, but they are a great starting point. Blocking a few out at a time helps piece together ideas and can fix big problems before you put too much work in. It’s a good idea to do 4 thumbnails to start, or if you get stuck. Thumbnails are immeasurably useful, and even the most advanced GraphicDesigners do them.</p>
